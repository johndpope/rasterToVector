# Vectorization project

This was a research project for my bachelor thesis:
"Comparison of Algorithms for Bezier Curve Fitting", which deals with fitting Bezier curves to polygons.

The goal of this project is to produce a vector image (e.g. SVG)
from a raster, this process is known as image tracing or vectorization.

Example of imput and output:


There are several stages to this:
